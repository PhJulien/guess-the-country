Guess the country is a small game developed with R Shiny. The aim was to showcase how powerful and versatile R amd Shiny are. 

In this trivia game, you have to guess the name a the country whose shape is displayed. It requires little more than 100 lines of code.

Few bugs yet have to be fixed, e.g. getting an error message when a country can not be drawn by the map function.
